# CustomStringUtilityClassWithLogging
This repository extends the String utility class from Assessment Task 1 to include test logging functionality. Test results are appended to a log file with date, time, success rate, and detailed outcomes for each test. The result.txt file under the Assessment_1 folder is where the results are written to upon testing.
